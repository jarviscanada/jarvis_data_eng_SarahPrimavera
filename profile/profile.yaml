# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a dedicated software developer with a diverse background in full-stack development, back-end development, 
  game design and IT support. With experience at Morgan Stanley, I have refined my knowledge of dynamic web solutions using 
  Angular and AG Grid, along with back-end functionalities with Python. At Vanier College, I had the opportunity to collaborate 
  with a client and develop an engaging educational game using Unity 2D and 3D.
  My technical background spans a wide range of languages including Java, Python, C#, PHP, and Dart, along with knowledge in 
  object-oriented programming, data structures, and design patterns. Some of my projects include a wardrobe management app using
  Flutter and Dart, along with Firebase Cloud as my database solution. Additionally, I received a certification from Udemy for completing
  a course in Node.js development to enhance my RESTful API skills.
  What excites me the most about the software development industry is the continuous learning and dynamic nature of the field. There's never
  a dull moment. I graduated from Vanier College where I was able to solidify my foundation in programming, databases, and web development.
  I enjoy leveraging my diverse skill set to create innovative and efficient software solutions.
